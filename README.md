# Silverstripe Fluent Export / Import

An extension for silvertripe/fluent to export and import translations.

Run `dev/tasks/fluent-export` to export all translations as a zip of yml files.

Then you can translate the content and import it again (to be done).

## Configuration

You can configure fields you don't want to export, e.g. SiteTree's URLSegment:

```yml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  translate_ignore:
    - URLSegment
```


## Todo
- [X] Export translations to YML
- [ ] Import translations from YML
- [ ] other file adapters like json or xliff
- [ ] better UI, e.g. in LocaleAdmin
